# The problem to be solved
- Creating a buffer using the [Common collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_collector) topology and include the following:
1. Deviation in amplitude 𝐴_2 ​for 𝑣_2 ​when 𝑣_0 ​is a sinusoidal signal with frequency 𝑓 = 1000 Hz and amplitude A_0​= 500 mV.
2. Maximum amplitude of 𝑣_0 ​before distortion in 𝑣_2 ​becomes visible.
3. Frequency response as well as the lower (and possibly upper) 3 dB cutoff frequency.
4. The results should be discussed. Which parameters in the circuit have an impact, and how could the results possibly be improved?
